### Typography

The fonts used in this quiz were selected from Google Fonts, a library of open-source fonts that offers a wide range of styles for various design needs. Two distinct fonts were chosen to complement the theme and enhance readability:

- Heading Font: The heading font, "Creepster", was chosen for its modern and unique style, adding a touch of playfulness and intrigue to the overall design.
- Body Font: For the body text, a traditional serif font was selected to provide a sharp contrast to the heading font. The serif font ensures easy readability, making it ideal for presenting questions and other content in the quiz.
By combining these fonts, the quiz achieves a harmonious balance between creativity and legibility, enhancing the overall user experience.
